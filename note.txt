There was a village near a jungle. The village cows used to go up to the jungle in search of food.

In the forest there lived a wicked lion. He used to kill a cow now and then and eat her. This was happening for quite sometime. The cows were frightened.

One day, all the cows held a meeting. An old cow said, “Listen everybody, the lion eats one of us only because we go into the jungle separately. From now on we will all be together”.

From then on all the cows went into the jungle in a herd. When they heard or saw the lion all of them unitedly moo and chased him away
